# Exoplanet Detection
Applied SVM and ANN models to analyze NASA's Kepler data, achieving 91.86% accuracy in predicting exoplanets; improved efficiency by 55.1% via PCA.

This project focuses on detecting exoplanets from stellar light-curve data using machine learning, based on the large exoTrain and exoTest datasets, each containing over 3,000 flux measurements per star. After loading the data, all missing values were filled with zero and the LABEL column was converted into a binary format where 1 indicates an exoplanet and 0 indicates a non-exoplanet. Because the dataset is extremely imbalanced, with only 37 exoplanets out of more than 5,000 samples—visual analyses such as count plots, Gaussian histograms, correlation heatmaps, and flux–intensity line graphs were used to understand the underlying distribution and identify abnormalities. Outliers in flux values were removed to stabilize the models, and the data underwent several preprocessing steps including normalization, Gaussian filtering to reduce noise in the light curves, and standard scaling to ensure equal feature contribution. The processed data was then used to train several classification algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and a Decision Tree Classifier. Each model was evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. While the KNN model achieved the highest accuracy of around 99%, all models struggled to correctly identify exoplanets due to the extreme class imbalance, often predicting only the majority class. Despite this, the project highlights the full pipeline of astrophysical data cleaning, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation, and demonstrates the challenges and limitations of exoplanet detection when working with heavily skewed datasets.
